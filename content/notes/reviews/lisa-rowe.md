I've seen Josh a few times for hip and back pain and the most recent visit was after injuring my shoulder from a fall on the ice. I couldn't work for a week but wow! He fixed my shoulder! He's knowledgeable and very fun to talk to! I'd definitely recommend Josh to anyone who has cronic pain or trying to recover from an injury.
